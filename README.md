# OSA-Xothian-Mk2
1K Joust fighter with staggered rail charge, packs high alpha strike potential into a light fighter.

The Mk2 Xothian is the pregenator to the 4 railgun Cthulhu used in the 3v3 tournement, using a staggered rail charge system to pack double the rails for its gen set up, 1k weight was the goal so that the ship qualified for Kais 3v3 tournament.

Estir is the 3k tournament variant, with materials min-maxed for the weight limit of 1000 tons, 143ms at 60 fps, this is provided for any future tournaments that Kai hosts.

//Specs//

2 railguns with a staggered charge system.

Shoot_1+ and Shoot_2+ are your triggers, bind these to your weapon hotkey (space by default).

Sensitivity settings are adjustable from a yolo chip located in front of the pilot seat, this chip only adjusts your sense settings and is not vital to the operation of the aim system, you can use the U-tool save feature to save your sense settings to the ship post print.

CenterSensePlus and CenterSenseMinus is your standard sensitivity, Adjust both to your preferred flying sensitivity.

AimMax- and AimMin- is your Aim hotkey, Bind both to the same keybind, this will lower your sensitivity, Adjust MinSensePlus and MinSenseMinus to change Aim sensitivity.

AimMax+ and AimMin+ is your Boost hotkey, Bind both to the same hotkey, this will raise your sensitivity, Adjust MaxSensePlus and MaxSenseMinus to change Boost sensitivity.

Ship is set to both fly and aim at a smooth sensitivity (tune to your taste), Aim keybind lowers the limits for sniping, Boost keybind removes these limits allowing for faster pitch/yaw.

Armoured using known methods of meta plating, including big plate health, voxel armour, segmented and layered plating and plasma/rail sacrifice plates.

Materials and components are on the high end, i leave it to the user to reduces cost to your tastes.

1035656.25 kg in weight, 142ms at 60fps.

1 small prop tanks for 1 million prop, 30 mins estimated flight time.

2 T3 fuel chamber, 6 T3 generators, 4 T3 enhancers 1 hour 20 mins estimated fight time.

Uses premium FCU, no reverse, Roll_L and Roll_R are your keybinds for roll.

Entry is through the back, there is a small gap above the thrusters.

//Design//

Unlike a more traditional fighting ship, the Xothian is made to fight using jousting instead of orbiting, focusing on hit and run tactics.

The key feature is the yolo controling the railgun charge, the ship is in reality a 1 rail fighter, with the ability to buffer a additional rail shot when the first is fully charged.

This provides several advantages, the additional rail shot doubles your damage when jousting your opponent, it also allows you to fire sooner with one railgun being ready to fire before charging the second, making snap firing at targets when they present themselfs easier, fianaly you are able to continuously fire 1 railgun at a high rate just as a equivelent sized single railgun ship.

Very slim flat profile from front and sides to reduce the ships sillohett when turning into jousts, the overall size and shape is very compact.

Primarily made of Oni and Dal plates, with the tourney variant using nalfite beams to hit the 1k weight limit.

Can be made into a lighter more affordable rail fighter by swapping plate mats, but some of the armour plates will lose effectiveness, particularly against rails/plasma.

Surrounding the ship is a beam roll cage along the likely points of collision with other ships, allowing other ships to strike plates can cause instant loss of vital armour, and cause shock to spread to the core ship structure, the cage aims to remedy this by spreading some shock around the cage, and by making the point of contact be on a beam, not a armour plate.

Crashing into a non beam protected ship causes more devastation to them than to you, this allows you to take greater risks without loosing your ship to collisions that are/are not deliberate.

Aggressively covered with cable spines, to expand the hit box surrounding the ship, by doing so, you can force a projectile to register before it hits your ship, which is one of the causes for desync shots phasing into your ship without interacting with plates, the announcement of no pause for desync kills in the tourney made this a needed precaution.

These spines also apply a "hit first" effect in collisions, allowing you to cause damage to a vital plate or component vs loosing a redundant and disposable cable spine.

Those with good internet and those who dislike collisions kills should remove these, as they do take up weight to a degree, those with bad internet, or aggressive flying, should probably keep them.

//Tactics//

As more ships are on the field, the chance of accedental collision increases, this is further excaserbated with orbit fighting.

To combat this, a heavier focus or delivering high alpha stike damage then running away was needed to avoid "moshpits" of orbit fighting.

Turn fighting is avoided, instead you fly past your target at max speed and fire your rails.

If the target is aiming at you as you make your pass, this tactic will streighten out you targets trajectory, making it much easier to land your rails.

Getting closer at speed also reduces the distance, and therfore reduces the lead needed to hit your target, point blank shots as you pass are more down to timing than accuracy.

If the target turns to chase you after you pass, they will dramaticaly drop speed, allowing you to pull range for anouther pass, it is recomended to make evasive manuvers as you exit your joust.

This stratagy is more effective the larger the battle, as jousting makes use of more space, and slows down fights to a more manageable speed.

Taking targets by surprise is more likley in a jousting fight, the ability to focus down specific targets as a team, or assist teammates who are being chased is much easier to pull of with the fight being more spaced out from jousting.

Rail ships lack the dps of reg gun spam, and as such pairing these with orbit fighters is a valid stratagy to cover the weaknesses of the joust stratagy.

Just one orbit fighter can provide a boost in dps and finishing power, at the cost of lower disabling power and alpha strike.

Overgunned rail ships like this, with correct flying have a amazing ability to punch up in weight, the slower acceleration and large plate surfaceses of large ships are perfect for you to target and kill.
