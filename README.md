# OSA-Xothian-Mk2
1K Joust fighter with staggered rail charge, packs high alpha strike potential into a light fighter.

The Mk2 Xothian is the progenitor to the 4 railgun Cthulhu used in the 3v3 tournament, using a staggered rail charge system to pack double the rails for its gen set up, 1k weight was the goal so that the ship qualified for Kais 3v3 tournament.

//Specs//

2 railguns with a staggered charge system.

Shoot_1+ and Shoot_2+ are your triggers, bind these to your weapon hotkeys (space by default).

Sensitivity settings are adjustable from a yolo chip located in front of the pilot seat, this chip only adjusts your sense settings and is not vital to the operation of the aim system, you can use the U-tool save feature to save your sense settings to the ship post print.

CenterSensePlus is your standard sensitivity, Adjust to your preferred flying sensitivity.

AimMax- and AimMin- is your Aim hotkey, Bind both to the same keybind, this will lower your sensitivity, Adjust MinSensePlus to change Aim sensitivity.

AimMax+ and AimMin+ is your Boost hotkey, Bind both to the same hotkey, this will raise your sensitivity, Adjust MaxSensePlus to change Boost sensitivity.

Ship is set to both fly and aim at a smooth sensitivity (tune to your taste), Aim keybind lowers the limits for sniping, Boost keybind removes these limits allowing for faster pitch/yaw.

Armoured using known methods of meta plating, including big plate health, voxel armour, segmented and layered plating and plasma/rail sacrifice plates.

Materials and components are on the high end, i leave it to the user to reduces cost to your tastes.

1035656.25 kg in weight, 142ms at 60fps.

1 small prop tanks for 1 million prop, 30 mins estimated flight time.

2 T3 fuel chamber, 6 T3 generators, 4 T3 enhancers 1 hour 20 mins estimated fight time.

Uses premium FCU, no reverse, Roll_L and Roll_R are your keybinds for roll.

Entry is through a slit on the bottom of the ship.

//Design//

Unlike a more traditional fighting ship, the Xothian is made to fight using jousting instead of orbiting, focusing on hit and run tactics.

The key feature is the yolo controlling the railgun charge, the ship is in reality a 1 rail fighter, with the ability to buffer a additional rail shot when the first is fully charged.

This provides several advantages, the additional rail shot doubles your damage when jousting your opponent, it also allows you to fire sooner with one railgun being ready to fire before charging the second, making snap firing at targets when they present themselves easier, finally you are able to continuously fire 1 railgun at a high rate just as a equivalent sized single railgun ship.

Very slim flat profile from front and sides to reduce the ships silhouette when turning into jousts, the overall size and shape is very compact.

Primarily made of Oni, Char and Ymr plates.

Can be made into a lighter more affordable rail fighter by swapping plate mats, but some of the armour plates will lose effectiveness, particularly against rails/plasma.

//Tactics//

As more ships are on the field, the chance of accidental collision increases, this is further exacerbated with orbit fighting.

To combat this, a heavier focus or delivering high alpha strike damage then running away was needed to avoid "moshpits" of orbit fighting.

Turn fighting is avoided, instead you fly past your target at max speed and fire your rails.

If the target is aiming at you as you make your pass, this tactic will straighten out you targets trajectory, making it much easier to land your rails.

Getting closer at speed also reduces the distance, and therefore reduces the lead needed to hit your target, point blank shots as you pass are more down to timing than accuracy.

If the target turns to chase you after you pass, they will dramatically drop speed, allowing you to pull range for another pass, it is recommended to make evasive manoeuvres as you exit your joust.

This strategy is more effective the larger the battle, as jousting makes use of more space, and slows down fights to a more manageable speed.

Taking targets by surprise is more likely in a jousting fight, the ability to focus down specific targets as a team, or assist teammates who are being chased is much easier to pull of with the fight being more spaced out from jousting.

Rail ships lack the dps of reg gun spam, and as such pairing these with orbit fighters is a valid inclusion to cover the weaknesses of the joust strategy.

Just one orbit fighter can provide a boost in dps and finishing power, at the cost of lower disabling power and alpha strike.

Over gunned rail ships like this, with correct flying have a amazing ability to punch up in weight, the slower acceleration and large plate surfaces of large ships are perfect for you to target and kill.
