# OSA Xothian Mk2
1K Joust fighter with staggered rail charge, packs high alpha strike potential into a light fighter.

The Mk2 Xothian is the pregenator to the 4 railgun Cthulhu used in the tournement, using a staggered rail charge system to pack double the rails for its gen set up, 1k weight was the goal so that the ship qualified for Kais 3v3 tournament.

Estir is the 3k tournament variants, with materials min-maxed for the weight limit of 1000 tons, 143ms at 60 fps, this is provided for any future tournaments that Kai hosts.

//Specs//

2 railguns with a staggered charge system.

Shoot_1+ and Shoot_2+ are your triggers, bind these to your weapon hotkey (space by default).

Sensitivity settings are adjustable from a yolo chip located in front of the pilot seat, this chip only adjusts your sense settings and is not vital to the operation of the aim system, you can use the U-tool save feature to save your sense settings to the ship post print.

CenterSensePlus and CenterSenseMinus is your standard sensitivity, Adjust both to your preferred flying sensitivity.

AimMax- and AimMin- is your Aim hotkey, Bind both to the same keybind, this will lower your sensitivity, Adjust MinSensePlus and MinSenseMinus to change Aim sensitivity.

AimMax+ and AimMin+ is your Boost hotkey, Bind both to the same hotkey, this will raise your sensitivity, Adjust MaxSensePlus and MaxSenseMinus to change Boost sensitivity.

Ship is set to both fly and aim at a smooth sensitivity (tune to your taste), Aim keybind lowers the limits for sniping, Boost keybind removes these limits allowing for faster pitch/yaw.

Armoured using known methods of meta plating, including big plate health, voxel armour, segmented and layered plating and plasma/rail sacrifice plates.

Materials and components are on the high end, i leave it to the user to reduces cost to your tastes.

1035656.25 kg in weight, 142ms at 60fps.

1 small prop tanks for 1 million prop, 30 mins estimated flight time.

2 T3 fuel chamber, 6 T3 generators, 4 T3 enhancers 1 hour 20 mins estimated fight time.

Uses premium FCU, no reverse, Roll_L and Roll_R are your keybinds for roll.

Entry is through the back, there is a small gap above the thrusters.

//Design//

Unlike a more traditional fighting ship, the 

The ship design takes advantage of mixing 4 autos with 4 plasma/laser with high tier gens to minmax power usage, allowing for great volume fire in both orbit and joust fighting.

It also comes with a large ammo box for the autocannons, adding 3 additional mags to the autos available firepower, while saving large amounts of space from not using any small auto mags.

Plasma/laser have there own mags, these weapons closely match the autos ammo expense.

Very slim wedge profile from front and sides make this a great turn fighter, the overall size and shape is very compact.

Primarily made of Oni and Dal plates, with the tourney variant using nalfite beams to hit the 1k weight limit.

Can be made into a lighter more affordable swarm fighter by swapping plate mats, but some of the armour plates will lose effectiveness, particularly against rails/plasma.

Surrounding the ship is a beam roll cage along the likely points of collision with other ships, allowing other ships to strike plates can cause instant loss of vital armour, and cause shock to spread to the core ship structure, the cage aims to remedy this by spreading some shock around the cage, and by making the point of contact be on a beam, not a armour plate.

Crashing into a non beam protected ship causes more devastation to them than to you, this allows you to take greater risks without loosing your ship to collisions that are/are not deliberate.

Aggressively covered with cable spines, to expand the hit box surrounding the ship, by doing so, you can force a projectile to register before it hits your ship, which is one of the causes for desync shots phasing into your ship without interacting with plates, the announcement of no pause for desync kills in the tourney made this a needed precaution.

These spines also apply a "hit first" effect in collisions, allowing you to cause damage to a vital plate or component vs loosing a redundant and disposable cable spine.

Those with good internet and those who dislike collisions kills should remove these, as they do take up weight to a degree, those with bad internet, or aggressive flying, should probably keep them.

//Tactics//

Made to perform in the pocket of fights as a lightweight bruiser, the Mk4 was my answer to any situation involving close range, unavoidable orbit combat during the tournament.

Plasma/auto was the main weapon choice for its high volume of fire, and its ability to deliver crippling damage close to railguns, even in jousts.

During Seal Clubs match against Ace Tech, the Yith was used to hunt the small nimble rail fighters that threatened our own rail fighters, then force fights with the larger flagship, providing space for our rail ships to snipe.

The weapons used by the Yith have greater critical hit chance than the supporting rail ships, providing a needed increase in finishing ability.

Best used by pilots used to the nuances of orbit fighting, but should still be used as a jouster in fleet fights to avoid "moshpits" of circling ships.

Pilots should switch from jousting to orbiting when either a dangerous target needs to be distracted from teammates, or when a hostile ship becomes damaged and is vulnerable to being finished by volume fire.

For live combat, the Yith is a more appealing base for a standard fleet, due the the high cost of railgun ships, mat cost is more adjustable all the way down to t1/t2, and the laser/auto offers a base to build a cheap fighter that can be built in mass.
